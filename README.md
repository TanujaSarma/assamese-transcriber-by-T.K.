"Academy.AI" Transcriber is a web application developed as a fifth semester minor project. It provides an AI-driven transcription tool that allows users 
to upload or record audio and get accurate Assamese text output. Alongside the transcription feature, the platform includes a student-focused roadmap to guide learners
through building projects, understanding key concepts, and improving practical skills.
